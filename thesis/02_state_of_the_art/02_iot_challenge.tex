\label{cha:iot_challenge}

IoT is a huge area of research and development over the few past year,
developer and researcher in this field face some serious challenge
\cite{DBLP:conf/mipro/2015}\cite{Gubbi20131645}\cite{bendickson2016}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Device diversity (Arduino, Raspberry PI, physical sensors, biometric
sensors)
\item Software implementation (Linux, iOS, Windows, Android)
\item Interactive modes (publisher/subscriber pattern, request/response
pattern, command pattern, pull/push pattern)
\item Engineering unit (degree Farenheit/degree Celsius, foot/metre, and
many more)
\item Power management and optimisation
\item Connectivity, the device is connected with various protocols like ZigBee
or MQTT
\item Reliability, the device could be instantly checked and have some error
handling application level
\item Data description, we need to annotate the produced data (raw data are a problem)
\item Various security problems:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Physical security
  \item Data exchange security
  \item Cloud storage security
  \item Update and patch
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In this part, a state of the art and some various approaches for the
IOT programming, development and design are presented. We will see some
programming language which one could be the target of the DSL we are creating
and some existing domain specific language. In the end, we fully describe the
challenge of the IOT in order to offer a language which is able to answer all
the developers wishes.

TODO

Power supply, power-optimized algorithm, network protocols

Dynamic power management (DPM), to shud down device when they donâ€™t need to be
online

DPM --> problem because of the latency and latency is an overall problem

Reliability: device could be constantely checked and Error handling procedure
in the application level

Data curation and data brokering: device could produce a huge ammount of data

Data projection

Data description: metadata to describe raw-data

Declarative programming for the IOT !!!

The concept of data source include some different information :

\begin{itemize}
\item The source device
\item The type of data
\item The sampling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Source device}
\label{subsec:dsl-design-source-device}

Firstly, we have to know that there is a lot of different existing device for
the IoT programming, some of them are just connected ones like bluethoot tracker
or smart device like fridge or door. For the purpose of the project we are just
going the take device that are sensor oriented. All we want is to gather
information for the environmment and communicate it further.

In order to manage a varous kind of device, we will use the PlatformIO tool.

The major property of Source is his developement framework. A lot of various framework exist for embeded programming :
